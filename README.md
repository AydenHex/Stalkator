A program to scrape data on social media, such as instagram, linkedin, facebook...

*For now it only scrapes instagram followers and following

*It only works on Windows

*You need Google Chrome up to date !

Instagram or linkedin limit the number of requests you can make with one account, this is why I chose to connect multiples clients with one server to scrape data more efficiently.


Step I - Launch the server

Step II - Launch the clients (it will connect to the server automatically)

Step III - Connect all your accounts

Step IV - Set a target then scrape the data
